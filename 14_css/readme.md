#### QCC:  
- While doing the gallery, we found that Team Chattering Chickens had written the Copyright as a footer. We used a different method but information like that is typically written with the footer tag.
- We also received clarification on how the site was supposed to look but left it the same to yield the same content
- What other DIAGs can we print for this assignment to ensure all parts are working correctly?
