- We can use os.urandom(<size>) to generate a string of random bytes of the specified size. We used this for our key.
- To see cookies, open dev console, go to storage, click cookies. (Ryan Lau on Piazza)
QCC:
- We can add labels for form inputs with <label for="{id}">{label text}</label> where {} denotes a field.
We used them to let users know where to input username and password.
- Redirect can be used with url_for or with the '<file_name>'.
